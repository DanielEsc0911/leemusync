## Reading paths
| Task | Read, in order |
|---|---|
| Sync logic, versions, conflicts, locks | sync-model → reliability → security §Cryptography |
| Add or fix an emulator | emulator-profiles → players-and-accounts → the platform spec |
| Add a storage provider | storage-backends → security §Credentials |
| UI screen or component | ui/design-system → ui/navigation → i18n |
| Tray, notifications, live surfaces | ui/status-and-notifications → the platform spec |
| Background or service behaviour | reliability → the platform spec |
| CLI or config | config-and-cli → i18n §Rust strings |
| CI, packaging, release | release → security §Supply chain → git-workflow |
