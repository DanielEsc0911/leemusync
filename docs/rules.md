# Rules

> **Status:** Decided · **Related:** [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), [decisions](decisions.md), [security](specs/security.md), [reliability](specs/reliability.md), [design-system](specs/ui/design-system.md) · **Code:** —

## How to use
- Rules win over convenience, deadlines and every other doc. If a spec conflicts with a rule, the spec has a bug.
- Cite rules by ID in reviews, commits and plans ("violates B2").
- A rule changes only with the maintainer's approval, recorded in [decisions.md](decisions.md).
- If a request would break a rule, say so, cite the ID, and propose a compliant alternative.

## Frontend: unbreakable
### F1 Same look on every platform
- **What:** One Flutter design system renders the same look on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS: same colors, type (bundled fonts), icons, components and motion.
- **May differ:** layout by screen-size class; platform input behaviours (scroll physics, back gesture, text-selection handles, keyboard shortcuts, window chrome, haptics); OS-owned surfaces (tray menus, notifications, Live Updates, Live Activities). OS-owned surfaces follow the platform's rules but use our icons, wording and status model.
- **Enforced by:** golden tests per size class × theme × locale ([testing](specs/testing.md)), review against [design-system](specs/ui/design-system.md).

### F2 Best possible performance; nothing broken
- **What:** 60 fps minimum, 120 fps on high-refresh displays, within the frame budgets in [design-system §Performance](specs/ui/design-system.md#performance). A feature ships only when it works end to end on every platform where it appears: no dead buttons, no "coming soon" in releases.
- **Enforced by:** profile-mode performance tests, the release checklist ([release](specs/release.md)).

### F3 Same navigation on every platform
- **What:** Same destinations, order, names and flow steps everywhere. Screen size changes the container (bottom bar / rail / sidebar, pushed page / side pane), never the flow.
- **Enforced by:** [navigation](specs/ui/navigation.md) is the source of truth; integration tests cover each flow per size class.

## Backend: unbreakable
### B1 Architecture that scales without breaking
- Layered crates whose dependencies only point down ([architecture §Layers](specs/architecture.md#layers), `cargo xtask layers`).
- One responsibility per file. Feature-first folders in Dart. No god modules.
- Every persisted or wire format (repo, manifest, profile schema, IPC, config) carries a version and has tested migrations. New features extend stored data and never break it.
- Breaking a public interface requires a decision entry.

### B2 Security first: no backdoors, no exploits
- End-to-end encryption is mandatory. Keys never leave devices unencrypted. No telemetry. No project-run server in the data path.
- No inbound network listeners. Local IPC is same-user only.
- Profiles, manifests, remote objects, config files and deep links are untrusted data, never code: no shell, no eval, no plugin loading, no remote profile downloads.
- File writes stay inside user-granted roots, and every path is validated.
- `unsafe` is forbidden outside the FFI bridge. Dependencies are minimal and audited. Releases are signed.
- Full model: [security](specs/security.md).

### B3 Reliability and performance, 24/7
- Never lose or corrupt a save: invariants I1–I6 in [reliability](specs/reliability.md#invariants).
- Always on wherever the OS allows: service managers, restart on crash, sleep inhibition during transfers, rescans on resume. Mobile uses every allowed background mechanism and documents its limits honestly.
- Light: the daemon stays within [reliability §Budgets](specs/reliability.md#budgets).

## Product
- **P1 KISS.** Pick the simplest design that satisfies every rule. No speculative features. A new dependency or component needs a written reason.
- **P2 Your storage, your data.** LeemuSync works with storage the user owns, runs no server and has no accounts. Only the user's devices can read the data.
- **P3 Any emulator, any layout.** Every emulator gets the safety features, and capabilities scale by tier ([emulator-profiles §Tiers](specs/emulator-profiles.md#tiers)). Folder layouts are user-overridable. Profiles are declarative data. Core never parses game save formats.
- **P4 Every platform, at its best.** Windows, macOS, Linux (x86_64, arm64), Raspberry Pi, Android and iOS, each using its best integration: tray/menu bar, Live Updates (Now Bar, Super Island), Live Activities and Dynamic Island, App Intents/Shortcuts, Quick Settings tiles.
- **P5 Simple by default, powerful underneath.** Defaults work with no configuration. Every setting can be reached in the UI (Advanced), the CLI and the config file. The CLI offers `--json`.
- **P6 English and Spanish.** Every user-facing string (app, CLI, tray, notifications, native extensions, store listings) exists in `en` and neutral Latin American `es`. No hard-coded strings. See [i18n](specs/i18n.md).
- **P7 Open source.** MPL-2.0, auditable and reproducible.

## Workflow
- **W1 Docs are code.** A behaviour change updates its spec in the same commit. A new spec goes into the [index](index.md). Specs link to each other in both directions.
- **W2 Test first.** Follow TDD. `just check` is green before every commit. Never claim work is done without running it.
- **W3 No unverified facts.** Vendor or platform behaviour that this repo hasn't proven goes under **Verify** with the spike that will prove it.
- **W4 Decisions are logged.** Record them in [decisions.md](decisions.md). Don't reopen one without new facts. A change gets a superseding entry.
- **W5 Commits.** Use Conventional Commits. The human maintainer is the author. AI agents add a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer ([git-workflow](specs/git-workflow.md)).
