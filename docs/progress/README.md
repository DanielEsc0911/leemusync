# Progress

> **Status:** Decided · **Related:** [roadmap](roadmap.md), [rules](../rules.md) (W1, W4), [git-workflow](../specs/git-workflow.md), [release](../specs/release.md#release-checklist), [skill: lemusync-docs](../../.claude/skills/lemusync-docs/SKILL.md) · **Code:** —

## How it works
- **[roadmap.md](roadmap.md):** phases, milestones and exit criteria. It changes only when scope changes.
- **`plans/<name>.md`:** one file per active plan (a whole phase, or one feature inside a phase), in the writing-plans format: goal, global constraints, tasks with checkboxes.
- **Progress is the ticked checkboxes**, committed together with the work they describe.
- **Durable knowledge never lives only in a plan.** Spike results, design changes and new decisions go into specs and `decisions.md` in the same commit (W1).
- **Cleanup:** when every task in a plan is done and merged to `main`, add its user-visible changes to `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]`, delete the plan file, and remove its board row. Git history keeps the plan.
- **Closed plans are history.** Their command shapes and examples stay as written then (for example `play <emulator> <game>`); the current ones are in the specs.
- **Next plan:** written at the end of the previous phase, once that phase's results are known (no speculative plans, P1).
